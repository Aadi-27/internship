1. In this tutorial we'll learn how to make our sites responsive without using any libraries/frameworks like Bootstrap
2. First of all, we need to understand how Bootstrap works to make sites responsive
    1. In the latest versions of BootStrap i.e. BootStrap 4, it mostly does the responsive work with CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid
    1. CSS Grid has changed the way responsiveness of a site is implemented, it is so easy to make your site responsive with the help of Grid
    1. Although CSS Grids won't do all the job for us, we still have to use a major responsive feature called the **Media Queries**
    1. So what are **Media Queries**? media queries are way to monitor the screen viewport width and height so that we can apply specific breakpoints to the site
